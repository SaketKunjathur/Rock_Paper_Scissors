# Rock_Paper_Scissors

In this game I have made the basic tic-tac-toe game with all the extra screens like menus, pause, how to play etc. and I have also added a save score button which would save the score according to 2 criterias. The rest of the the game is pretty much the simple tic-tac-toe game.

## 2 criterias for saving the score
Firstly the game saves the score into a txt file name 'score.txt' and then it check if wether the player has hit a highscore, if yes then it replaces the score in the file with the player's score (NOTE: you don't need to create any txt file for the score or highscore cause the program analyses wether the particular place where the program is stored, has any file named 'score.txt' if not then it creates one and then stores the score(although if ou create one already the program won't show you any error and if it does then you may check the name of the file, ALTHOUGH you need to create that 'highscore.txt' file or just download it from this repository).
